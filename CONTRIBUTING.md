## Reporting Issues

If you find a bug or have a suggestion:

1. First check if someone else has already reported it in [Issues](../../issues)
2. If not, create a new issue
3. Try to be as detailed as possible, for example:
   - What were you doing when the problem occurred
   - What did you expect to happen
   - What actually happened
   - Your VS Code version and operating system

## Want to Change Code?

Super welcome! Though I'm still learning, so please bear with me if the code isn't perfect ?
